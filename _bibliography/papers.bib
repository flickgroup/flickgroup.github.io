abstract = {For certain correlated electron–photon systems we construct the exact density-to-potential maps, which are the basic ingredients of a density-functional reformulation of coupled matter-photon problems. We do so for numerically exactly solvable models consisting of up to four fermionic sites coupled to a single photon mode. We show that the recently introduced concept of the intra-system steepening (Dimitrov et al 2016 New J. Phys. 18 083004) can be generalized to coupled fermion-boson systems and that the intra-system steepening indicates strong exchange-correlation effects due to the coupling between electrons and photons. The reliability of the mean-field approximation to the electron–photon interaction is investigated and its failure in the strong coupling regime analyzed. We highlight how the intra-system steepening of the exact density-to-potential maps becomes apparent also in observables such as the photon number or the polarizability of the electronic subsystem. We finally show that a change in functional variables can make these observables behave more smoothly and exemplify that the density-to-potential maps can give us physical insights into the behavior of coupled electron–photon systems by identifying a very large polarizability due to ultra-strong electron–photon coupling.}

abstract = {Traditionally, quantum chemistry investigates molecular systems assuming that the photon field, which leads to the interaction of charged particles, is well approximated by the Coulomb interaction. On the other hand, quantum optics describe the photon field in detail while approximating the matter systems via few levels. Recent experiments at the interface between these two areas of research have uncovered situations where both the molecular system and the photon field have to be treated in detail. In this work, we show how theoretical approaches have to be adapted to treat such coupled matter–photon problems and which effects can be anticipated. Our quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism provides the theoretical framework to open a field of research able to deal with emergent properties of matter. In this work, we provide an overview of how well-established concepts in the fields of quantum chemistry and material sciences have to be adapted when the quantum nature of light becomes important in correlated matter–photon problems. We analyze model systems in optical cavities, where the matter–photon interaction is considered from the weak- to the strong-coupling limit and for individual photon modes as well as for the multimode case. We identify fundamental changes in Born–Oppenheimer surfaces, spectroscopic quantities, conical intersections, and efficiency for quantum control. We conclude by applying our recently developed quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory to spontaneous emission and show how a straightforward approximation accurately describes the correlated electron–photon dynamics. This work paves the way to describe matter–photon interactions from first principles and addresses the emergence of new states of matter in chemistry and material science.}}

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) is a well-established method to study many-electron systems. Over the past decades advanced algorithms have been designed that allow even large systems to be solved computationally very efficiently. Only recently, DFT has been generalized to correctly incorporate the quantum nature of light, which becomes important, e.g., in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In general, the accuracy in density-functional theory depends crucially on the capability to construct good approximations that reflect the features of the exact effective potential for the Kohn–Sham system. In this work, we introduce a fixed-point scheme to construct these exact effective potentials for a cavity QED system and demonstrate their features for the ground-state and time-dependent situations. The density-functional approach to quantum electrodynamics extends traditional density-functional theory and opens the possibility to describe electron–photon interactions in terms of effective Kohn–Sham potentials. In this work, we numerically construct the exact electron–photon Kohn–Sham potentials for a prototype system that consists of a trapped electron coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. Although the effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective potential that mark the breakdown of classical light–matter interactions. We observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be attributed solely to the quantum nature of light; i.e., they are real-space signatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole interaction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in real space to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field fully into account.}}

abstract = {Abstract The relevance of receptor conformational change during ligand binding is well documented for many pharmaceutically relevant receptors, but is still not fully accounted for in in silico docking methods. While there has been significant progress in treatment of receptor side chain flexibility sampling of backbone flexibility remains challenging because the conformational space expands dramatically and the scoring function must balance protein–protein and protein–ligand contributions. Here, we investigate an efficient multistage backbone reconstruction algorithm for large loop regions in the receptor and demonstrate that treatment of backbone receptor flexibility significantly improves binding mode prediction starting from apo structures and in cross docking simulations. For three different kinase receptors in which large flexible loops reconstruct upon ligand binding, we demonstrate that treatment of backbone flexibility results in accurate models of the complexes in simulations starting from the apo structure. At the example of the DFG-motif in the p38 kinase, we also show how loop reconstruction can be used to model allosteric binding. Our approach thus paves the way to treat the complex process of receptor reconstruction upon ligand binding in docking simulations and may help to design new ligands with high specificity by exploitation of allosteric mechanisms. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
