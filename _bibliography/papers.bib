    abstract = "{We present an ab initio method for computing vibro-polariton and phonon-polariton spectra of molecules and solids coupled to the photon modes of optical cavities. We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes with both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of the cavity Born–Oppenheimer approximation, spectra can be expressed in terms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements, which are readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory implementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters can be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure calculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in terms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response properties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges, which enter into the vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response properties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain the Γ point phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for a selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to demonstrate the method.}",

abstract = {Abstract The silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond is drawing much attention due to its optical and spin properties, attractive for quantum information processing and sensing. Comparatively little is known, however, about the dynamics governing SiV charge state interconversion mainly due to challenges associated with generating, stabilizing, and characterizing all possible charge states, particularly at room temperature. Here, multi-color confocal microscopy and density functional theory are used to examine photo-induced SiV recombination — from neutral, to single-, to double-negatively charged — over a broad spectral window in chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) diamond under ambient conditions. For the SiV0 to SiV- transition, a linear growth of the photo-recombination rate with laser power at all observed wavelengths is found, a hallmark of single photon dynamics. Laser excitation of SiV‒, on the other hand, yields only fractional recombination into SiV2‒, a finding that is interpreted in terms of a photo-activated electron tunneling process from proximal nitrogen atoms.},

In particular, the origin of resonant effects between the cavity and certain vibrational modes in the collective limit is still subject to active research. In this paper, we study the unimolecular dissociation reactions of many molecules, collectively interacting with an infrared cavity mode, through their vibrational dipole moment. We find that the reaction rate can slow down by increasing the number of aligned molecules, if the cavity mode is resonant with a vibrational mode of the molecules. We also discover a simple scaling relation that scales with the collective Rabi splitting, to estimate the onset of reaction rate modification by collective vibrational strong coupling and numerically demonstrate these effects for up to 104 molecules.}",

Our calculations indicate that electrons localize at the dangling bonds associated with a tungsten vacancy (VW) and at the Er3+ ion site, even in the presence of a net negative charge in the supercell. The system features a set of intra-gap defect states, some of which are reminiscent of those present in isolated Er3+ ions. In both instances, the level of hybridization is low, i.e., orbitals show either strong Er or W character. Through the calculation of the absorption spectrum as a function of wavelength, we identify a broad set of transitions, including one possibly consistent with the Er3+ 4I15/2→4I13/2 observed in other hosts. Combined with the low native concentration of spin-active nuclei as well as the two-dimensional nature of the host, these properties reveal Er:WS2 as a potential platform for realizing spin qubits that can be subsequently integrated with other nanoscale optoelectronic devices.}

Unfortunately, their atomic structures remain largely elusive and only a small percentage of the emitters studied thus far have the properties required to serve as optically addressable spin qubits. Here, we use confocal fluorescence microscopy at variable temperatures to study a new class of point defects produced via cerium ion implantation in thin hBN flakes. We find that, to a significant fraction, emitters show bright room-temperature emission, and good optical stability suggesting the formation of Ce-based point defects. Using density functional theory (DFT) we calculate the emission properties of candidate emitters, and single out the CeVB center\&\#x2014;formed by an interlayer Ce atom adjacent to a boron vacancy\&\#x2014;as one possible microscopic model. Our results suggest an intriguing route to defect engineering that simultaneously exploits the singular properties of rare-earth ions and the versatility of two-dimensional material hosts.},

Ab initio theoretical predictions of these systems need to combine non-perturbative, many-body electronic structure theory-based methods with cavity quantum electrodynamics and theories of open-quantum systems. Here, we generalize quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory to account for dissipative dynamics of the cavity and describe coupled cavity–single molecule interactions in the weak-to-strong-coupling regimes. Specifically, to establish this generalized technique, we study excited-state dynamics and spectral responses of benzene and toluene under weak-to-strong light–matter coupling. By tuning the coupling, we achieve cavity-mediated energy transfer between electronically excited states. This generalized ab initio quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory treatment can be naturally extended to describe cavity-mediated interactions in arbitrary electromagnetic environments, accessing correlated light–matter observables and thereby closing the gap between electronic structure theory, quantum optics, and nanophotonics.}",

In particular, we demonstrate the applicability of our methodology by calculating the polaritonic excited-state manifold of a formaldehyde molecule strongly coupled to an optical cavity. This proof-of-concept calculation shows how strong coupling can be exploited to alter photochemical reaction pathways by influencing avoided crossings with tuning of the cavity frequency and coupling strength. Therefore, by introducing an ab initio method to calculate excited-state potential-energy surfaces, our work opens a new avenue for the field of polaritonic chemistry.}",

    abstract = "{Over the last few years, extraordinary advances in experimental and theoretical tools have allowed us to monitor and control matter at short time and atomic scales with a high degree of precision. An appealing and challenging route toward engineering materials with tailored properties is to find ways to design or selectively manipulate materials, especially at the quantum level. To this end, having a state-of-the-art ab initio computer simulation tool that enables a reliable and accurate simulation of light-induced changes in the physical and chemical properties of complex systems is of utmost importance. The first principles real-space-based Octopus project was born with that idea in mind, i.e., to provide a unique framework that allows us to describe non-equilibrium phenomena in molecular complexes, low dimensional materials, and extended systems by accounting for electronic, ionic, and photon quantum mechanical effects within a generalized time-dependent density functional theory. This article aims to present the new features that have been implemented over the last few years, including technical developments related to performance and massive parallelism. We also describe the major theoretical developments to address ultrafast light-driven processes, such as the new theoretical framework of quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism for the description of novel light–matter hybrid states. Those advances, and others being released soon as part of the Octopus package, will allow the scientific community to simulate and characterize spatial and time-resolved spectroscopies, ultrafast phenomena in molecules and materials, and new emergent states of matter (quantum electrodynamical-materials).}",

abstract = {For certain correlated electron–photon systems we construct the exact density-to-potential maps, which are the basic ingredients of a density-functional reformulation of coupled matter-photon problems. We do so for numerically exactly solvable models consisting of up to four fermionic sites coupled to a single photon mode. We show that the recently introduced concept of the intra-system steepening (Dimitrov et al 2016 New J. Phys. 18 083004) can be generalized to coupled fermion-boson systems and that the intra-system steepening indicates strong exchange-correlation effects due to the coupling between electrons and photons. The reliability of the mean-field approximation to the electron–photon interaction is investigated and its failure in the strong coupling regime analyzed. We highlight how the intra-system steepening of the exact density-to-potential maps becomes apparent also in observables such as the photon number or the polarizability of the electronic subsystem. We finally show that a change in functional variables can make these observables behave more smoothly and exemplify that the density-to-potential maps can give us physical insights into the behavior of coupled electron–photon systems by identifying a very large polarizability due to ultra-strong electron–photon coupling.}

abstract = {Traditionally, quantum chemistry investigates molecular systems assuming that the photon field, which leads to the interaction of charged particles, is well approximated by the Coulomb interaction. On the other hand, quantum optics describe the photon field in detail while approximating the matter systems via few levels. Recent experiments at the interface between these two areas of research have uncovered situations where both the molecular system and the photon field have to be treated in detail. In this work, we show how theoretical approaches have to be adapted to treat such coupled matter–photon problems and which effects can be anticipated. Our quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism provides the theoretical framework to open a field of research able to deal with emergent properties of matter. In this work, we provide an overview of how well-established concepts in the fields of quantum chemistry and material sciences have to be adapted when the quantum nature of light becomes important in correlated matter–photon problems. We analyze model systems in optical cavities, where the matter–photon interaction is considered from the weak- to the strong-coupling limit and for individual photon modes as well as for the multimode case. We identify fundamental changes in Born–Oppenheimer surfaces, spectroscopic quantities, conical intersections, and efficiency for quantum control. We conclude by applying our recently developed quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory to spontaneous emission and show how a straightforward approximation accurately describes the correlated electron–photon dynamics. This work paves the way to describe matter–photon interactions from first principles and addresses the emergence of new states of matter in chemistry and material science.}}

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) is a well-established method to study many-electron systems. Over the past decades advanced algorithms have been designed that allow even large systems to be solved computationally very efficiently. Only recently, DFT has been generalized to correctly incorporate the quantum nature of light, which becomes important, e.g., in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In general, the accuracy in density-functional theory depends crucially on the capability to construct good approximations that reflect the features of the exact effective potential for the Kohn–Sham system. In this work, we introduce a fixed-point scheme to construct these exact effective potentials for a cavity QED system and demonstrate their features for the ground-state and time-dependent situations. The density-functional approach to quantum electrodynamics extends traditional density-functional theory and opens the possibility to describe electron–photon interactions in terms of effective Kohn–Sham potentials. In this work, we numerically construct the exact electron–photon Kohn–Sham potentials for a prototype system that consists of a trapped electron coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. Although the effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective potential that mark the breakdown of classical light–matter interactions. We observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be attributed solely to the quantum nature of light; i.e., they are real-space signatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole interaction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in real space to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field fully into account.}}

abstract = {Abstract The relevance of receptor conformational change during ligand binding is well documented for many pharmaceutically relevant receptors, but is still not fully accounted for in in silico docking methods. While there has been significant progress in treatment of receptor side chain flexibility sampling of backbone flexibility remains challenging because the conformational space expands dramatically and the scoring function must balance protein–protein and protein–ligand contributions. Here, we investigate an efficient multistage backbone reconstruction algorithm for large loop regions in the receptor and demonstrate that treatment of backbone receptor flexibility significantly improves binding mode prediction starting from apo structures and in cross docking simulations. For three different kinase receptors in which large flexible loops reconstruct upon ligand binding, we demonstrate that treatment of backbone flexibility results in accurate models of the complexes in simulations starting from the apo structure. At the example of the DFG-motif in the p38 kinase, we also show how loop reconstruction can be used to model allosteric binding. Our approach thus paves the way to treat the complex process of receptor reconstruction upon ligand binding in docking simulations and may help to design new ligands with high specificity by exploitation of allosteric mechanisms. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
