The field of polaritonic chemistry seeks to understand how strong light-matter interactions influence chemical reactions. Experimental advances have been accompanied by the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED) ab initio methods, such as quantum electrodynamics density functional theory (QED-DFT) and quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster methods (QED-CC), in which both electrons and photons are treated quantum mechanically. Although these methods have provided significant insight into chemical reactions inside a cavity, these methods rely on numerous approximations. Therefore, these methods are expected to fail in the correct description of strongly correlated systems which play a crucial role in transition metal chemistry, photochemistry, catalysis, and bond-breaking processes, among others. Strongly correlated systems can be accurately described with multireference quantum chemistry methods. However, these methods scale factorially with system size, making them currently unsuitable for simulating large molecules. Quantum algorithms offer an alternative way for solving complex chemical problems.

In the Flick group, we use quantum computing algorithms to develop novel ways to accurately simulate polaritonic systems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. We exploit the unique properties of polaritonic systems to implement existing algorithms in new ways, develop new algorithms, and mitigate quantum computing error.
