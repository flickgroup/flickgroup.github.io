Our group is interested in the electronic structure of a wide range of systems, with a particular focus on systems where the interaction between light and matter becomes strong. We study  molecular systems and materials in optical cavities, as well as quantum defects in wide-band gap materials. To describe these systems, we develop theoretical methods, such as quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) and others.
